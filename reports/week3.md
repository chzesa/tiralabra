This week has mostly been working on the visualization of the algorithm and fixing bugs discovered in the process. I added basic untested implementations for the priority queue and for an unbalanced binary tree but since they're untested they aren't used. The tree will need to be balanced for the runtime guarantee as well.

A blatantly obvious issue with the algorithm currently is that it doesn't work at least in part because the beachline isn't correctly ordered. This is most likely due to the parabola generated by the new site `a` being degenerate, and as a result the new arc has zero width. Therefore, if the site `b` generating the arc directly above `a` is to the left of `a` the order of the arcs is inverted. This behaviour is correct for removing arcs in a circle events, but creating a disambiguation for newly added arcs likely requires inspecting the sites recorded on the boundary itself and that they be ordered logically.

I've since solved the previous problem. I've noticed cases where the generation completely breaks down, which is either due to some unconsidered edge cases or rounding issues.
