This week has primarily been consumed by figuring out how to handle edge cases. The algorithm still runs into errors frequently with segment endpoints being inverted, but this is not so frequent that it wouldn't allow performance testing data to be generated.

What does prevent it is a new edge case in which two circle events to constantly spawn each other causing the algorithm to never terminate, and it's not something that I've observed happening with reasonably sized input making debugging difficult.
